# instructions on how to run this project
- After cloning the repo
- npm install
- cd to the root folder
- and run "npm run dev" to start the server and the client side concurrently

# test with the following registered credentials
- "email": "firstuser@doheneyserives.com",
- "password": "firstuser@123"

# tech tools used 
- frontend
: React, Redux (for state management), Tailwind for styling components
- backend
: Nodejs/ExpressJs(framework) , MongoDB as database


# Fullstack Developer Assessment
A technical assessment exercise. The purpose of this exercise is to assess your ability across several skills including;

```
# Time management and prioritisation
# Code organisation
# Familiarity with the core technologies
# Documentation
```

You are not necessarily required to complete the exercise but we encourage spending at least 5 hours to showcase as much as you can.

If you have any questions please email smoses@doheneyservices.com

## Technologies

### Frontend
- Nextjs / ReactJs
- Context API / Redux
- Bootstrap / Material UI / Tailwind CSS 

### Backend
- NestJs / Express
- GraphQl / REST

## Quesiton:
Given the UI design https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pAvYbn7HgPYDrhiBJzgXnAgnhuV9Vfiz?usp=drive_link:

Using any of the technology above:

a) Develop the login page provided in the drive above (Note: font-family: Montserrat)

b) Create an endpoint to login user provided that you have a list of user records. 

```
[
    {
        id: 1
        name: 'First User',
        email: 'firstuser@doheneyserives.com'
        password: 'firstuser@123'
    },
    {
        id: 2
        name: 'Second User',
        email: 'seconduser@doheneyserives.com'
        password: 'seconduser@123'
    }
]
    
```

c) Once the login is successful navigate to a blank page and display user's name and ensure the data is persisted


Once completed, share instructions on how we can review the code and run
the application.
